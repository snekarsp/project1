Project Prerequisites
The requirement for this Python project is a webcam through which we will capture images. You need to have Python (3.6 version recommended) installed on your system, then using pip, you can install the necessary packages.

OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (face and eye detection).
TensorFlow – pip install tensorflow (keras uses TensorFlow as backend).
Keras – pip install keras (to build our classification model).
Pygame – pip install pygame (to play alarm sound).

Driver Drowsiness Detection Execution
Let’s execute drive drowsiness detection system and see the working of our ml project. To start the project, you need to open a command prompt, go to the directory where our main file “drowsiness detection.py” exists. Run the script with this command.

python “drowsiness detection.py”
It may take a few seconds to open the webcam and start detection.
